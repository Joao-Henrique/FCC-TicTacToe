# Tic Tac Toe

### Project description:
+ This is a "revamp" of my Tic Tac Toe Game Project made for [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) FrontEnd Certification using HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript. You can play it. Just choose to play with X or O and then place your character on the board. The computer turn is not using any fancy algorithm like min-max. It uses a simple Math.random() so try not to get the beating of your life :)
